## What is the shell?

Find a good in-depth explanation [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/index.html).

The shell is a program that gives you a way to access commands that let you do stuff on your computer. 

We are going to learn all of the most common commands and how we can combine them to automate complex tasks.

It is also called the command-line interface because you type commands on a line like this:

> ```$ do-the-thing ```

In this case we are using BaSh (Born Again Shell), but there are lots of differnet shells. BaSh is very common on UNIX and Linux operating systems.

## The three shells used in this workshop

### Windows

If you are on Windows you are using the BsSh emulator that you installed with Git. This is an emulator because it basically fakes the real BaSh commands to make them work on Windows.

### MacOS

MacOS is built on UNIX so it has a built-in command-line with all of the UNIX commands we need for this workshop.

### Linux

Most versions of Linux come with BaSh by default.
